<h1>Interactive Role Play - Variables</h1>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The idea of this role play is to try and help the kids understand the concept of what a variable is and how they can be used.</p>
<p>By getting the kids to participate in a real world activity, they can hopefully make the connection between what they are doing and what they are coding.</p>
</section>
<section id="basic-premise" class="level2">
<h2>Basic Premise</h2>
<p>The basic idea is that the volunteer will attempt to &quot;program&quot; the children. This is done by firstly selecting a volunteer to stand in the front of the class on the <code>stage</code> and act as the <code>sprite</code>. The volunteer then writes a <code>script</code> on the board and selects another volunteer to &quot;run&quot; the code by reading out each command, slowly, allowing time for the <code>sprite</code> to perform the command.</p>
<p>The commands can become more complex and start to include variables.</p>
</section>
<section id="concepts-covered" class="level2">
<h2>Concepts covered</h2>
<p>This role play should help the kids understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>stage</code><br /></li>
<li>What a <code>sprite</code> is<br /></li>
<li>What a <code>script</code> is<br /></li>
<li>What a <code>variable</code> is<br /></li>
<li>Why a <code>variable</code> is used<br /></li>
<li>The difference between <code>variables</code> for 'all sprites' and for 'this sprite only'</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="example-script" class="level2">
<h2>Example script</h2>
<p>First start with a simple <code>script</code>:</p>
<p><code>- When Aaron claps his hands - Walk to Sally - Say 'Hello Sally'</code></p>
<p>The <code>sprite</code> will probably be a bit confused for the first one, so encourage the person &quot;running&quot; the <code>script</code> to read each command slowly, and encourage the <code>sprite</code> to execute the command.</p>
<p>Now pick a new name:</p>
<p><code>- When Aaron claps his hands - Walk to Sam - Say 'Hello Sam'</code></p>
<p>Again, have someone &quot;run&quot; the <code>script</code>.</p>
<p>Now try and illustrate to the kids how, when you want to change the name, you have to do so in multiple places.<br />Ask them how we might be able to save ourselves from changing the name in multiple places.<br />If they don't think of it already, suggest that maybe we could put a placeholder in there. Maybe a <code>variable</code>.</p>
<p>Change the <code>script</code> as follows:</p>
<p>``</p>
<ul>
<li>When Aaron claps his hands<br /></li>
<li>Walk to <name><br /></li>
<li>Say 'Hello <name>'</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>variable <name> = Jenny<br />``</p>
<p>Ask a child to 'execute' the program. They will more than likely read out \<name\> instead of substituting the real name in for the <code>variable</code>. Guide them through this.</p>
<p>Then ask the children to change the name <code>variable</code> and &quot;see what the program does&quot;.</p>
<p>``</p>
<ul>
<li>When Aaron claps his hands<br /></li>
<li>Walk to <name><br /></li>
<li>Say 'Hello <name>'</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>variable <name> = James<br />``</p>
<p>By now, the kids should be getting a hang of how changing a <code>variable</code> changes the way the <code>script</code> executes.<br />Time to step it up a notch.</p>
<p>Now ask for 3 more volunteers. We are about to run a program with 3 <code>sprite</code>s at once.</p>
<p>Once again choose a new value for the \<name\> <code>variable</code>:</p>
<p>``</p>
<ul>
<li>When Aaron claps his hands<br /></li>
<li>Walk to <name><br /></li>
<li>Say 'Hello <name>'</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>variable <name> = Sarah<br />``</p>
<p>Ask the class what they think will happen when they execute the program.<br />Have the class to execute the program that now has 3 <code>sprite</code>s and ask them why all 3 <code>sprite</code>s went to the same person. By now they should be able to allude to the fact that all 3 <code>sprite</code>s were sharing the same \<name\> <code>variable</code>.</p>
<p>Now for the kicker. Ask the kids how we might be able to get the 3 <code>sprite</code>s to each go to a different person. You may well find that they suggest you give each <code>sprite</code> their own <code>variable</code>.</p>
<p>So do that:</p>
<p>``</p>
<ul>
<li>When Aaron claps his hands<br /></li>
<li>Walk to <name><br /></li>
<li>Say 'Hello <name>'</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>variable for sprite1: <name> = Melissa<br />variable for sprite2: <name> = Mark<br />variable for sprite3: <name> = Matthew<br />``</p>
<p>Execute the <code>script</code> and the <code>sprite</code>s should end up at their designated people.</p>
<p>Now try to get the class to reiterate why the <code>sprite</code>s went to the different people this time as opposed to the time before.</p>
<p>BOOM, you're done. Your kids now understand the basic concept of <code>variable</code>s..</p>
