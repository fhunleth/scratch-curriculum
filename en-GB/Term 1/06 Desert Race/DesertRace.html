<h1>Desert Race</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br />This game is a two player game where you race a parrot and a lion across the desert. Each player has to press a key as fast as they can to move their animal, the first one to reach the edge of the screen wins.</p>
<section id="step-1-create-the-scene-and-add-the-sprites" class="level2">
<h2>STEP 1: Create the scene and add the sprites</h2>
<ol>
<li>Select the Stage, and add the desert background.<br />ticking off the boxes below:<br /></li>
<li>Add a new sprite, select the lion sprite that you will find in the animals folder.<br /></li>
<li>Add another sprite, select the parrot sprite that you will find in the animals folder.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="step-2-make-the-lion-and-the-parrot-move" class="level2">
<h2>STEP 2: Make the lion and the parrot move</h2>
<p>We want the sprite to move when you press a key.</p>
<ol>
<li>First select the lion sprite and set it to move 4 steps when you press the ‘L’ key.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when l key pressed
    move 4 steps</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Next, select the parrot sprite and set it to move 4 steps when you press the ‘A’ key.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when a key pressed
    move 4 steps</code></pre>
<section id="test-your-project" class="level3">
<h3>Test Your Project</h3>
<p><strong>Click the green flag</strong><br />Do your lion and parrot move across the screen when you press the ‘A’ and ‘L’ keys?</p>
<p>Save your project</p>

</section>
<section id="step-3-starting-the-race" class="level2">
<h2>STEP 3: Starting the race</h2>
<p>We need to have a way to start the race and to know who has won. <strong>First we create a start button.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add a new sprite from a file. Choose the button sprite which is inside “things”.<br /></li>
<li>Edit the costume of the button sprite, add the text ‘start’ to it and click OK. Move the sprite to the middle of the stage.<br /></li>
<li>Now add a script that shows the sprite when the project is run:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when FLAG clicked
    show</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Now we want the button to count down from 3 and then say go and then hide when it is clicked. Add another script like this one:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when StartRace clicked
    say 3 for 1 secs
    say 2 for 1 secs
    say 1 for 1 secs
    say GO! for 1 secs
    hide</code></pre>
<section id="test-your-project-1" class="level3">
<h3>Test Your Project</h3>
<p><strong>Click on the green flag.</strong></p>
<p>When you press the start button does it countdown to the start of the race before disappearing?</p>
<p>Save your project</p>
<p>We only want the racers to move after the race has started and we want to know when the race has finished so we need a variable to hold that information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a variable for all sprites called racing. Untick the box next to it so it does not show on the stage.<br /></li>
<li>Now set racing to be 0 when the project is first started. Change your <code>when FLAG clicked</code> script from before to look like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when FLAG clicked
    show
    set racing to 0</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Next, set the racing variable to be 1 when the starting countdown has finished.<br /></li>
<li>Now we need to stop the lion and the parrot from moving unless the racing variable is set to be 1. Click on the parrot sprite. <strong>Add a control block to the script</strong> that only allows the<br />parrot to move if <strong>racing = 1</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when a key pressed
    if racing = 1
        move 4 steps
    (end if)</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Now do the same for the lion sprite.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="test-your-project-2" class="level3">
<h3>Test Your Project</h3>
<p><strong>Click on the green flag.</strong></p>
<p>Does the lion or the parrot move only after the countdown has finished?</p>
<p>We want to know who wins the race and reset it when it has finished so you can<br />race again.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="step-4-finishing-the-race" class="level2">
<h2>STEP 4: Finishing the race</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add a block to the parrot’s script that sets the racing variable to be 0 when the sprite touches the edge of the screen.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when a key pressed
    if racing = 1
        move 4 steps
        if touching edge?
            set racing to 0
        (end if)
    (end if)</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Now we want the parrot to let us know if it wins the race. Record a new sound for the Parrot sprite that will be played when the parrot wins. Click <strong>sounds</strong> and then record the sound of the parrot winning the race!<br /></li>
<li>Now add blocks that play the sound you recorded and makes the parrot say it has won:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when a key pressed
    if racing = 1
        move 4 steps
        if touching edge?
            set racing to 0
            play sound recording1
            say The Parrot Wins! for 3 secs
        (end if)
    (end if)</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Now repeat these steps for the lion.</li>
</ol>
<section id="test-your-project-3" class="level3">
<h3>Test Your Project</h3>
<p><strong>Click on the green flag.</strong></p>
<p>Can you press the start button and race by pressing the ‘A’ and ‘L’ keys?<br />Do the sprites make their winning sound and say they’ve won when they reach the end of the race?</p>
<p>Save your project</p>

<section id="step-5-resetting-the-game" class="level2">
<h2>STEP 5: Resetting the game</h2>
<p>After the race is finished we need to tell the other sprites we have won and reset the<br />game so we can play again.</p>
<p><strong>We need the winning sprite to broadcast that it has won.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Parrot sprite.<br />Add a block that broadcasts “finished” after the sprite says it has won.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when a key pressed
    if racing = 1
        move 4 steps
        if touching edge?
            set racing to 0
            play sound recording1
            say The Parrot Wins! for 3 secs
            broadcast finished
        (end if)
    (end if)</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Now we need to add a new script that listens for the finished broadcast and moves the parrot<br />back to the start. What happens if you change the value that x is set to?</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when I receive finished
    set x to -175</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Now add the same script for the lion. Test different x values to make sure the lion and the parrot line up at the start.<br /></li>
<li>We also want to put the lion and the parrot in the same position when the project is run, so add another script to each that moves them to the start<br />when we click the flag.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="scratch"><code>
    when FLAG clicked
    set x to -175</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><p>Now click on the button sprite and add a script that shows it when it receives the finished message.</p>
<h3>Test Your Project</h3>
<p><strong>Click on the green flag.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Can you race against a friend, one of you moving the parrot by pressing ‘A’ and the<br />other moving the Lion by pressing ‘L’?</p>

<h2>Challenge: Add a booster</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try to add a booster</strong> that you can use once each race that moves the parrot or the lion <strong>30 steps in 1 go.</strong><br /></li>
<li><strong>Add a new costume</strong> with fire coming out behind for each sprite and make it appear when the boost is pressed.<br /></li>
